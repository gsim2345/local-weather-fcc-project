# local-weather-fcc-project
Show the Local Weather freeCodeCamp challenge.
The objective was to create a weather app that shows the local weather, shows a different icon or background image depending on the weather, and the temperature can be toggled between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
I built in an extra search possibility.

I used HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Material Design for Bootstrap to build the page, and the browsers Geolocation API, darksky.net's weather API, and Google's Geocode API to get location and weather data.
